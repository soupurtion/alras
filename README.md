Automated Lab Room Allocation System
The Cyber Security Innovation Center (CSIC) faces challenges in efficient allocation of lab rooms to its students. The current manual reservation process is cumbersome and time-consuming for both the lab coordinator and the cyber security students. This inefficiency results in delays, conflicts, and a lack of real-time room availability information. This is an implement an automated lab room allocation system that enables students to check real-time room availability, request slots without coordinator approval where applicable, and efficiently manage lab room reservations.
